### Game Description
In this game the computer selects a random word and the player has to guess it by guessing a letter each turn. If the player guesses correctly, the word is filled in, if not, the player is one step closer to the hangman!

### Instructions
The computer begins by loading in a dictionary of 10,000 words from Github and randomly selecting a secret word. You will then make a guess and the terminal will then display the current iteration of the hangman, all guesses so far and the current secret word with the correct guesses filled in. You will also have the option to load and save your progress, which are saved as YAML file in the saved_games folder.
