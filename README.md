# ruby_hangman

As part of my progress through The Odin Project's Ruby course, I have built a Hangman game. During this game:

- The computer will load in a dictionary of 10,000 words from Github and randomly select a secret word
- The user will make a guess
- The computer will then display the current iteration of the hangman, all guesses so far and the current secret word with the correct guesses filled in 
- The user also has the option to load and save their files, which are saved as YAML file in the saved_games folder.
